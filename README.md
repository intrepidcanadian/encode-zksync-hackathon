Summary

Digital Verification of Supply Chain to enhance transparency, reduce ineffiencies, and facilitate B2B cross-border trade. 

Verified Credentials are stored on-chain zkSync Era blockchain. The verified credentials and verified presentation use JPMorgan's SDK for encryption to create a unique DID and a JWT for packaging the schema.

Additional use of Streamr to make private broadcasts of each wallet address that has a DID for more supply chain transparency.

Smart contract so that payments are only made between a shipper and a carrier when consignees sign the delivery and are held in escrow. 
The consignees only recieve cargo when they send funds to shipper. This cuts out banks that might typically be involved in escrow, inefficient paper Bill of Ladings and increases supply chain transparency (schema) and trust.

Use applications can be:

(1) verifying content of shipment that is signed by the shipper prior to assigning ownership to the carrier which helps allocate liability. 
(2) leveraging information uniquely tied to a DID for proof of origins (i.e. whether the lumber originated from Canada or certain products were affected by disease).
(3) increasing trust and transparency through cryptographic methods and e-delivery (removing paper Bill of Ladings)
(4) enhance B2B commerce by having escrow payments released through smart contracts
(5) transparency of items tied uniquely to wallet addresses that have DIDs but also privacy using Streamr private broadcasts to certain ethereum wallet addresses for subscription
(6) zkSync Era blockchain for storing DID and ensuring only the correct Shipper or Consignees can sign into the contract for facilitating payments
